Here are some of the technical people who were on the original launch :

He names the two major financial sposors :Microsoft and Google.

Also mentions these sponsors :
    *Exploring Computer Science Group (ECS) http://www.exploringcs.org/ 
    *The Computer Science Teacher's Association (CSTA) http://csta.acm.org/
    which is part of acm. 
    *NCWIT
    *The ACM itself.

But the code for the code.dot.org website is line at github.
https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org is has 24 branches

From those branches there are only these 6 even close to up to date, that shows
a weak amount of contributions. 

Some of the contributions :

https://github.com/cloud3edu/code-dot-org http://cloud3edu.cn/ is a chinese
    company that has been doing commits. TheShanghai School of Education
    Science and Technology Co., Ltd.

https://github.com/kaiqigong is also from shanghai and seems to be working with
that company.
https://github.com/rhc2104 is contributing.
https://github.com/ottok/code-dot-org ottok is a finnish company.
https://github.com/pickettd is a contributor.


See the original code.org website here

He says that all curriculum will be under an creative commons license
"All curriculum resources and tutorials we author are free to use under a
Creative Commons license" on the website it says.
But according to the https://code.org/tos many of the popular images used are
not licensed for reuse.

The curriculum is supposed to be creative commons, but it is not hosted on the
site and not in an open source format, it is linked as a pdf file on
amazon. There is no history of the curriculum and it is also using creative
commons non commercial which is troubling on it's own.

See the ruling in Germany on the non commercial usage, it is very restrictive.
