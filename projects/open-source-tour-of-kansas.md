## [Free/Libre Open Source and Open Knowledge Association of Kansas](http://www.openkansas.us/)
###  Open Source Tour of Kansas

We would like to organize a yearly tour of Kansas, we will visit all the
cities with hacklabs and open source groups to visit them, and also organize
presentations in libraries and public places. This open source tour of Kansas
will be like a caravan.
