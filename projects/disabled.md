###  Disabled

Disabled people can benefit from using Open Source and Open Knowledge. Many
times the software available to disabled people is inflexible and expensive.
Open source software can be modified and improved to suit the needs of people.

  

We support the Sonar Gnu/Linux Project

See here a large resource of social and disabled resources we have compiled
for Kansas
