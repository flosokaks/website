###  Educational and Social Institutions

We would like to compile a list of Educational Institutions in Kansas and
contact them to promote the usage of F./LOSS and Open Knowledge.

  
We will create information packages, videos, live cds and even workshops and
trainings for schools and universities. We will try and organize youth groups
in different schools to promote the goals of our organization.

  

Part of the list overlaps with the list of disabled resources
