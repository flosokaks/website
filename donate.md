###  Donate

Please consider making a small donation to the Free/Libre Open Source and Open
Knowledge Association of Kansas. Money will be used towards project, seminars,
hosting and the conference. We will be accountable for all money spent.

The payment page will show you Introspector Software Services, the account
holder James Michael DuPont who is hosting this for now until we have our own
bank account.
